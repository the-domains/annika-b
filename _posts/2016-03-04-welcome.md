# [Welcome][0]

I grew up in Ottawa, Ontario and completed my undergraduate degree in Cultural Studies at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec. I graduated with my MFA in Poetry from Florida International University in Miami, Florida in 2015\. 

In a phrase, I would define myself as a media-savvy writer, editor and collaborator. Adept at research, content creation and editing for creative and professional outlets, I incorporate my experience with rhetoric and creative writing into all of my projects. My audience is always the focus, and concept is always driving me forward.

Today I am an assistant editor at a trade publication, and I freelance edit books and write copy. In the past, I worked in Sid Lee's strategy department as a business analyst and blogger. You can find my poems in Prelude, Cosmonaut's Avenue, and the Eight Miami Poets anthology from Jai Alai Books. Recently, I've started a friend-making service for women in South Florida, Lady Crush.

To explore my creative and professional work, I invite you to visit the following sections. 

If you want to see my teaching materials and learn about my pedagogical approach, please visit my portfolio.
